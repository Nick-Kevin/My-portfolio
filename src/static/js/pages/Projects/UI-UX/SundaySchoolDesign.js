	'During my 6-month internship at the FJKM Andravoahangy Fivavahana Church\'s IT department, I had the opportunity to craft the \'Sunday School\' UI/UX design project. This endeavor focuses on enhancing the digital experience for the church\'s Sunday School attendees. Through thoughtful design elements and user-centric approaches, \'Sunday School\' embodies my dedication to creating impactful and intuitive digital solutions within a religious and community-oriented context.',
